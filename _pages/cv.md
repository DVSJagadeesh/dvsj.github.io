## [Profile]({{ base_path }}/)
Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Large Language Models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. I combine strong research foundations with hands-on system building, with three IEEE publications and practical experience applying ML and NLP to real-world problems. Passionate about designing intelligent systems that bridge research and industry. 

## Technical Skills
* **Core:** Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, Agile Software Development
* **AI/ML:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, RAG Systems
* **Languages:** Java, Python, C++, C
* **Tools/Tech:** TensorFlow, SQL

## Education
* **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** (Sept 2021 - July 2025)
  * **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University**
    * CGPA: 8.65, First Class with Distinction.
* **Exchange Program** (Feb 2025 - July 2025)
  * *University of Twente*
    * Conducted research on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate engaging historical narratives.
    * Evaluated Semantic, Hybrid, and Graph-Based RAG approaches to optimize narrative coherence and mitigate hallucinations.

## Professional Experience 
* **Standard Chartered**
  * **Apprentice- Technology** (Sept 2024 - Present)
    * Worked on building an internal Retail & Wealth Banking (RW) Tool enabling admins to approve subscriber requests and operations teams to fetch reports, built using React and Spring Boot.
    * Designed and integrated PostgreSQL database schemas to support efficient data retrieval.

## Leadership & Experience
* **Toastmasters International**
  * **Area G3 Director** (July 2024 - June 2025)
    * Served five corporate clubs with ~130 professionals and leaders across the industry.
    * Achieved 100% club retention, and Select Distinguished Status.
  * Organized Feb 2024 Leadership Conclave with a team of four, over the course of three months, securing a keynote address and two executive-led panel discussions in a corporate venue. (2023-24)
  * Revitalized an underperforming club through targeted strategic planning. (2023-24)

## Publications & Projects
* [**Weaving Stories: using LLMs to generate historical narratives**](Weaving_Stories_FinalReport.pdf) (Feb 2025 - July 2025)
  * *Engineered a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform historical facts into engaging, interactive narratives.*
  * *Developed and compared Semantic, Hybrid, and Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures.*
  * *Demonstrated through user studies that Graph-Based RAG significantly outperforms other methods in narrative coherence, understandability, and user engagement.*
* **Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis from Patients Speech Analysis (IEEE)** (Oct 2023 - Dec 2023)
  * *Achieved 95% diagnostic accuracy using Random Forest and XGBoost, utilizing SHAP to identify the top 6 most influential features.*
* **Deep Learning-Based Analysis of Pediatric Pneumonia Detection in Children using Fine-tuned NasNetMobile Model (IEEE)** (Mar 2024 - May 2024)
  * *Achieved a 92% F-score in pediatric pneumonia detection by fine-tuning a NasNetMobile CNN architecture with Mish activation on a dataset of over 5,000 chest X-rays.*
* **Comparative Image Analysis of Chest X-RAY Image Encryption using Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption Algorithms (IEEE)** (Mar 2024 - May 2024)
  * *Identified AES with RSA as the optimal multilayer encryption strategy for medical images, delivering the best decryption speed while guaranteeing Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication (CIA).*
