### Comparative Image Analysis of Chest X-RAY Image Encryption using Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption Algorithms.  IEEE, 2024
CONTRIBUTORS: Bhupathi Vishva Pavani; Challagulla Sai Bhumika; **Dumpa Venkata Sai Jagadeesh**; C.R. Kavitha

Explored multilayer encryption strategies for medical image protection. Compared, and analyzed AES and DES encryption with RSA and DSS digital signatures on chest X-rays. AES with RSA yielded the best performance in decryption speed while ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication (CIA).
