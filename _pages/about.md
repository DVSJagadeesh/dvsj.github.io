I am V. S. Jagadeesh, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, currently working as an Apprentice at **Standard Chartered**, specifically focusing on **SAP Analytics Cloud**. 

During my undergraduate studies, I was selected as an Exchange Student at the University of Twente, where I worked on my Bachelor’s thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Lorenzo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W21Zb70AAAAJ&hl=it). My work focused on building and analyzing a Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, [Weaving Stories](https://github.com/DVSJagadeesh/Weaving-Stories-using-LLMs-to-generate-historical-narratives-Interface/blob/main/Weaving_Stories_FinalReport.pdf), for generating story like narratives grounded in historical facts by connecting Large Language Models to external history datasets. I evaluated multiple RAG variants (Hybrid, Semantic, and Graph-based) through a user study, analyzing coherence, understandability, and engagement, with Graph-based RAG showing the strongest overall performance. 

Through this project and my prior work in machine learning, I developed a strong interest in **how large language models behave internally**, particularly in scenarios involving **hallucinations**, **unsafe outputs**, and **reliability failures**. I am especially interested in the intersection of **LLM interpretability**, **safety**, and **evaluation**, with the goal of understanding why models fail and how they can be made more **trustworthy** in real world deployment.

Alongside my technical work, I value clear communication and structured thinking, which I have developed through leadership roles, including serving as an Area Director in **Toastmasters International** (District 92, 2024–25). Outside of work, I enjoy reading crime and thriller novels.

I’m always interested in discussions and collaborations around LLM interpretability, safety, factuality, evaluation, and real world AI reliability!
